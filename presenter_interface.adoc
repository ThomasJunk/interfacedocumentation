[small]#Executes some presenting function on the server. The term "presenting" means a non writing (or modifying) idempotent request There may be some side-effect allowed (like tracking calls to one presenter), but the main purpose is to get data of the server, which is not autoupdate-, projector-, or icc-data. Some purposes may be:#

[small]#- aggregating of login data#

[small]#- managing of whoami, if additional data is needed, that the auth service doesn't provide#

[small]#- To get history points#

[small]#- To get history data#

[small]#- To get the installed version#

[small]#- To query statistics#

[small]#- To calculate recursive trees (e.g. origins of motions; not possible with the autoupdate service)#

[small]#- to synchronize the servertime for countdowns#

[small]#@throws PresenterException This exception might be thrown, if there was an server error (Http-500-equivalent). For user error (e.g. wrong data) use the PresenterError interface.#
